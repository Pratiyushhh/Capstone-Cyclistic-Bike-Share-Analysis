# Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Lily Moreno, Director of Marketing & Cyclistic Executive Team  
**Prepared by:** Pratiyush Kumar, Junior Data Analyst  
**Business Question:** How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Introduction

**Cyclistic** is a bike-share program based in Chicago that operates a fleet of more than 5,800 bicycles and nearly 700 docking stations. Since launching in 2016, Cyclistic has provided flexible pricing plans—single-ride passes, day passes, and annual memberships—that attract a broad range of riders. Customers who purchase single-ride or day passes are classified as *casual riders*, while those with annual subscriptions are referred to as *members*.

From a business perspective, members generate significantly more long-term revenue than casual riders. Consequently, Cyclistic’s marketing team has identified a strategic opportunity: converting casual riders into annual members. To pursue this, it is essential to understand how members and casual riders use the system differently.

The purpose of this analysis is to explore 12 months of historical trip data from August 2024 to July 2025. Using R for data processing, cleaning, and visualization, this report aims to answer the primary business question:

> ***How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?***

Insights derived from this analysis will inform targeted marketing strategies designed to increase annual memberships. Key findings will be communicated through well-structured visuals and data summaries, providing the executive team with clear, evidence-based recommendations to support decision-making.

## Key Findings

**Fundamental Behavioral Difference:** Annual members prioritize efficiency (12.0-minute trips, 12.4 km/h speed) while casual riders prioritize leisure exploration (20.2-minute trips, 9.7 km/h speed).

**Massive Conversion Opportunity:** 1.55 million casual leisure trips annually represent 155,000+ potential member conversions at a 10% rate, with 233,000+ at 15% rate.

**Optimal Timing Identified:** Spring campaigns (March-May) offer maximum impact as casual activity increases 2.5x from winter baseline.

**No Technology Barriers:** Both groups embrace electric bikes equally (57% adoption), eliminating technology adoption friction.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Spring Conversion Campaigns:** Launch March-May when casual usage rebounds
2. **Efficiency-Focused Messaging:** "Complete trips 1.7x faster as a member"
3. **Weekend-to-Weekday Expansion:** Target leisure riders with commute convenience

## Expected Business Impact

- **Revenue Growth:** 155,000+ new annual members at 10% conversion rate
- **Operational Stability:** Reduced seasonal cash flow volatility
- **Market Position:** Premium urban mobility solution differentiation

# Ask Phase: Defining the Business Challenge

## Stakeholder Context

As a junior data analyst who joined Cyclistic's marketing analytics team six months ago, I've been assigned a critical business question by Lily Moreno, our Director of Marketing. The company's future growth depends on converting our existing casual riders into profitable annual members.

**Primary Stakeholder: Lily Moreno**

-   Director of Marketing responsible for campaign development
-   Needs evidence-based insights for targeted conversion strategies
-   Must present compelling case to executive team for budget approval

**Secondary Stakeholder: Cyclistic Executive Team**

-   "Notoriously detail-oriented" decision-makers
-   Require compelling data insights and professional visualizations
-   Will approve or reject recommended marketing programs

## Business Problem Statement

**Challenge:** Annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders, but we need to understand behavioral differences to design effective conversion campaigns.

**Opportunity:** Rather than acquiring new customers, convert existing casual riders who already know and use Cyclistic.

**Strategic Goal:** Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Success Criteria

1.  **Clear Behavioral Differences:** Identify how members and casual riders use bikes differently
2.  **Actionable Insights:** Provide specific, data-driven recommendations
3.  **Executive-Ready Presentation:** Professional visualizations for stakeholder communication
4.  **Implementation Roadmap:** Strategic guidance for marketing campaign development

**Primary Business Question:** How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

This analysis will inform targeted marketing strategies to increase annual memberships and drive long-term revenue growth.

# Prepare Phase: Building the Data Foundation

## Data Strategy for Executive Decision-Making

To answer Lily Moreno's critical business question, I'll analyze 12 months of Cyclistic's historical trip data to identify behavioral patterns that inform conversion strategies.

## Data Source & Credibility (ROCCC Assessment)

1.  **Reliable:** *First-party operational data*

    -   Direct measurement from Cyclistic's bike-share system
    -   Consistent data collection methodology across all stations
    -   Large sample size: 5.47+ million trips analyzed

2.  **Original:** *Primary source data*

    -   Real customer behavior, not surveys or estimates
    -   Comprehensive trip-level detail (time, location, duration, bike type)
    -   No third-party interpretation or aggregation bias

3.  **Comprehensive:** *Limited by privacy constraints*

    -   Complete trip details for behavioral analysis
    -   No personal identifiers (cannot track individual users)
    -   No demographic data (age, gender, income, location)
    -   **Business Impact:** Cannot identify repeat casual users or demographic segments

4.  **Current:** *Recent behavioral data*

    -   August 2024 - July 2025 (12 months of complete data)
    -   Captures current post-pandemic usage patterns
    -   Includes full seasonal variations for strategic timing

5.  **Cited:** *Properly licensed*

    -   Motivate International Inc. open license
    -   Public dataset appropriate for business analysis
    -   Compliant with data privacy regulations

## Data Limitations & Business Implications

**Cannot Determine:**

-   Individual user journey patterns
-   Demographic preferences
-   Geographic residence of users
-   Repeat casual user behavior

**Can Determine:**

-   Aggregate behavioral differences
-   Seasonal and temporal patterns
-   Trip characteristics and preferences
-   Geographic usage patterns

**Strategic Impact:** Analysis will focus on behavioral segments rather than individual user profiles, which aligns with digital marketing campaign targeting.

**Data Preparation Pipeline Initiated:**

### *Duration Logic Validation*

```{r data-cleaning-duration}
# Calculate trip duration and remove outliers
all_trips_clean <- all_trips_clean %>%
  mutate(ride_length_min = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")))

# Remove trips under 1 minute (likely false starts) and over 24 hours (likely errors)
short_trips <- sum(all_trips_clean$ride_length_min < 1, na.rm = TRUE)
long_trips <- sum(all_trips_clean$ride_length_min > 1440, na.rm = TRUE)

all_trips_clean <- all_trips_clean %>%
  filter(
    ride_length_min >= 1,      # At least 1 minute
    ride_length_min <= 1440    # At most 24 hours (1440 minutes)
  )
```

chicago_lng_max <- -87.5

# Find trips outside service area
outlier_coords <- all_trips_clean %>%
  filter(
    start_lat < chicago_lat_min | start_lat > chicago_lat_max |
    start_lng < chicago_lng_min | start_lng > chicago_lng_max |
    end_lat < chicago_lat_min | end_lat > chicago_lat_max |
    end_lng < chicago_lng_min | end_lng > chicago_lng_max
  ) %>%
  nrow()

all_trips_clean <- all_trips_clean %>%
  filter(
    start_lat >= chicago_lat_min, start_lat <= chicago_lat_max,
    start_lng >= chicago_lng_min, start_lng <= chicago_lng_max,
    end_lat >= chicago_lat_min, end_lat <= chicago_lat_max,
    end_lng >= chicago_lng_min, end_lng <= chicago_lng_max
  )
```

- *Removed `r comma(outlier_coords)` trips with coordinates outside Chicago service area*
- *Maintained focus on core market geography*

### *Speed Validation for Realistic Usage*

```{r speed-validation}
# Calculate trip metrics for business analysis
all_trips_clean <- all_trips_clean %>%
  mutate(
    # Distance using Haversine formula
    ride_distance_km = distHaversine(
      cbind(start_lng, start_lat),
      cbind(end_lng, end_lat)
    ) / 1000,
    # Calculate average speed
    avg_speed_kmh = ifelse(ride_length_min > 0,
                          (ride_distance_km / ride_length_min) * 60, 0)
  )

# Remove trips with unrealistic speeds (over 50 km/h - likely data errors)
high_speed_trips <- sum(all_trips_clean$avg_speed_kmh > 50, na.rm = TRUE)
all_trips_clean <- all_trips_clean %>%
  filter(avg_speed_kmh <= 50)
```

- *Removed `r comma(high_speed_trips)` trips with unrealistic speeds (>50 km/h)*

  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarise(
    total_trips = n(),
    avg_duration_min = round(mean(ride_length_min), 1),
    median_duration_min = round(median(ride_length_min), 1),
    avg_distance_km = round(mean(ride_distance_km, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    avg_speed_kmh = round(mean(avg_speed_kmh, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
    electric_bike_pct = round(mean(bike_preference == "Electric") * 100, 1),
    weekend_pct = round(mean(weekend == "Weekend") * 100, 1),

                   "Weekend Usage (%)", "Rush Hour (%)", "Market Share (%)"))
```

### *Executive Behavioral Insights*

-   **Trip Volume:** Casual riders represent `r casual_stats$trip_percentage`% of total usage
-   **Duration Difference:** `r duration_multiplier`x longer trips (`r casual_stats$avg_duration_min` vs `r member_stats$avg_duration_min` minutes)
-   **Speed Difference:** Members ride `r speed_multiplier`x faster (`r member_stats$avg_speed_kmh` km/h vs `r casual_stats$avg_speed_kmh` km/h)
-   **Weekend Focus:** Casual riders are `r weekend_ratio`x more weekend-oriented (`r casual_stats$weekend_pct`% vs `r member_stats$weekend_pct`%)

### *Strategic Finding #1: Fundamental Purpose Difference*

-   **Data Insight:** Casual trips average `r casual_stats$avg_duration_min` minutes vs member trips at `r member_stats$avg_duration_min` minutes (`r duration_multiplier`x difference)
-   **Business Interpretation:** Different mental models - casual riders explore for leisure, members optimize for efficiency
-   **Marketing Implication:** Messaging must emphasize time-saving and convenience value propositions

### *Strategic Finding #2: Speed and Efficiency Focus*

-   **Data Insight:** Members travel `r speed_multiplier`x faster than casual riders despite similar distances
-   **Business Interpretation:** Members demonstrate goal-oriented, efficient transportation behavior
-   **Campaign Implication:** *"Get there faster"* messaging will resonate with conversion targets

## Temporal Analysis: Campaign Timing Intelligence

```{r temporal-analysis}
# Hourly patterns for campaign timing strategy
hourly_patterns <- all_trips_clean %>%
  group_by(start_hour, user_type) %>%
  summarise(trip_count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  mutate(hourly_percentage = round(trip_count / sum(trip_count) * 100, 2))

# Rush hour analysis for commute behavior identification
rush_hour_analysis <- all_trips_clean %>%
  group_by(rush_hour, user_type) %>%
  summarise(trip_count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  mutate(rush_percentage = round(trip_count / sum(trip_count) * 100, 1))

member_morning_rush <- rush_hour_analysis %>%

  pull(rush_percentage)

morning_rush_ratio <- round(member_morning_rush / casual_morning_rush, 1)

print(rush_hour_analysis)
```

### *Temporal Intelligence for Campaign Strategy*

-   **Morning Rush Dominance:** Members `r member_morning_rush`% vs Casual `r casual_morning_rush`%
-   **Commute Indicator:** Members are `r morning_rush_ratio`x more likely to ride during morning commute hours
-   **Evening Rush:** Usage converges between Members and Casual Riders, reflecting both commuting and leisure activity
-   **Strategic Implication:** Target casual riders during non-rush periods
